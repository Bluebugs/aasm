Description: advanced assembler base files
 Aasm is an advanced assembler designed to support several target
 architectures. It has been designed to be easily extended and,
 should be considered as a good alternative to monolithic assembler
 development for each new target CPUs and binary file formats.
 .
 Aasm should make assembly programming easier for developer, by
 providing a set of advanced features: symbol scopes, expressions engine,
 big integer support, numerous and accurate warning messages, filter
 modules... Its dynamic modular architecture enables aasm to extend
 its set of features with plug-ins.
